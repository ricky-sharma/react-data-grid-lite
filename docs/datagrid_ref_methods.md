### üì¶ Imperative Grid API (`ref` methods)

The **DataGrid** component exposes a set of **imperative methods** through a `ref` using React‚Äôs `useImperativeHandle` hook. This allows parent or consuming components to programmatically interact with and control the grid beyond the declarative prop-based API.

By using these methods, you can perform actions such as retrieving filtered or selected rows, resetting the grid, or getting the current page ‚Äî all from outside the DataGrid component itself.

#### How to Use

To access these methods, create a React ref and attach it to your `<DataGrid />` component:

```jsx
import { useRef } from 'react';

const gridRef = useRef();

<DataGrid
  ref={gridRef}
  /* other props */
 />
```

You can then call any exposed method via `gridRef.current` after the grid mounts.

#### üîç Available Methods

##### `getFilteredRows()`

Returns an array of rows currently displayed in the grid, reflecting any applied search, filter, or sorting criteria.

```js
const filteredRows = gridRef.current.getFilteredRows();
```

---

##### `getFilteredSelectedRows()`

Returns an array of rows that are **both selected and currently visible** in the filtered view.

```js
const selectedFilteredRows = gridRef.current.getFilteredSelectedRows();
```

---

##### `getAllSelectedRows()`

Returns an array of **all selected rows**, including those that might be filtered out or on other pages.

```js
const allSelectedRows = gridRef.current.getAllSelectedRows();
```

---

##### `getCurrentPage()`

Returns the current page number that the grid is displaying.

```js
const currentPage = gridRef.current.getCurrentPage();
```

---

##### `resetGrid()`

Resets the grid to its initial state by:

* Clearing all selected rows
* Resetting pagination to the first page
* Clearing any applied filters and sorting

```js
gridRef.current.resetGrid();
```

---

##### `clearSelectedRows()`

Clears the current selection of rows in the grid ‚Äî **without affecting** filters, pagination, or sorting.

```js
gridRef.current.clearSelectedRows();
```

### Why Use These Methods?

These imperative APIs are particularly useful when you need to:

* Export selected rows to a file
* Sync grid state with other UI components
* Implement custom toolbar buttons that reset or modify grid state
* Perform bulk operations based on current selection or filters

They give you full control over the grid‚Äôs behavior from parent components, making your DataGrid implementation more flexible and powerful.
